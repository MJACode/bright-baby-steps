# Claude Code Guidelines — Baby Steps

## Reuse Before You Build

Before creating a new component, hook, utility, or migration, check whether something already exists that can be extended or reused.

**Checklist before building new:**
- Is there an existing component that handles a similar UI pattern? (e.g., a dialog, a card, a form)
- Is there a hook that already fetches or mutates the relevant data?
- Is there a Supabase storage bucket or table that can be extended with a new column rather than a new table?
- Can an existing prop or config option cover the new use case without a new abstraction?

**When reuse makes sense:**
- The existing code handles 80%+ of the new use case with minor extension (new prop, new column, new state)
- The change is additive and won't break existing consumers
- The abstraction already fits the domain (e.g., `AddChildDialog` getting an edit mode vs. a separate `EditChildDialog`)

**When a new component/file makes sense:**
- The new feature has meaningfully different concerns, layout, or lifecycle from existing components
- Extending the existing code would require significant conditionals that hurt readability
- The new thing will be reused in 2+ places and deserves its own abstraction

**Default rule:** Extend first, extract later. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction, but a well-placed prop is better than a duplicate component.

## Project Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions with SSE streaming)
- @tanstack/react-query for server state
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- React Router v6

## Key Conventions

- All server state lives in React Query hooks under `src/hooks/`
- Supabase schema changes go in `supabase/migrations/` with a timestamp prefix
- Preferences that don't need to sync across devices use `localStorage` via `usePreferences`
- AI chat uses SSE streaming — never use `supabase.functions.invoke` for streaming calls; use `fetch` with a `ReadableStream` reader
- The `:::CREATE_CHILD:::{JSON}:::END:::` marker pattern is used by the onboarding AI skill to trigger child creation client-side
